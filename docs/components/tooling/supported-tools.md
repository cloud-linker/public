# Supported Tools

## Introduction

CloudLinker follows a **zero-trust** approachâ€”**we never have access to your cluster or network**. Instead, all interactions happen via the CLI on the administrator's machine, which has the necessary permissions to connect to the cluster.

To ensure a production-grade infrastructure, CloudLinker installs and manages essential tools categorized into different areas. Each category has a list of supported providers that integrate seamlessly with CloudLinker.

Additionally, CloudLinker handles **updates, maintenance, and compatibility checks** to ensure a seamless and secure experience.
