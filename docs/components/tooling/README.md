# Tooling

## Introduction

CloudLinker automates the setup and management of all essential tools required for operating both infrastructure and applications within a Kubernetes cluster. From monitoring and security to collaboration tools, CloudLinker ensures a seamless and production-ready environment for businesses.

### Zero-Trust Security Model

CloudLinker is built on a **zero-trust** security approach. This means:

* **We do not have access to your cluster or network.**
* **All actions are performed using the CLI on the administrator’s machine**, which has a direct connection to the cluster.
* **All Cloud resources are private** and only necessary services are exposed via an Ingress Controller and a Load Balancer.

### What CloudLinker Provides

Each CloudLinker cluster comes pre-configured with:

#### **1. Infrastructure & Security Tooling**

* **Monitoring & Observability**: Integrated monitoring solutions to track cluster health and performance.
* **Logging & Metrics**: Centralized logging and metric collection for troubleshooting and analysis.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Secure access management for different user roles.

#### **2. Application Management**

* **Networking & Service Discovery**: Automatic configuration of internal networking.
* **Ingress Management**: Securely expose services with built-in ingress controllers.
* **Storage Solutions**: Persistent storage setup for applications requiring stateful workloads.

#### **3. Collaboration & Productivity Tools (Coming Soon)**

CloudLinker is expanding its offering to include built-in business collaboration tools:

* **Status Pages & Health Check Monitors**: Keep track of application uptime and service availability.
* **Video/Audio Meetings & Chat**: Integrated communication tools for teams.
* **Virtual Workspaces**: A centralized environment for collaboration.
* **Zulip (Slack Alternative)**: Team messaging with topic-based organization.

### Seamless Deployment & Automation

CloudLinker ensures that all tooling is:

* **Pre-installed and configured** upon cluster creation.
* **Automatically updated** to maintain security and reliability.
* **Easily customizable**, allowing users to extend or modify components as needed.

### Conclusion

With CloudLinker, businesses get a fully equipped Kubernetes cluster without the complexity of manual setup. Whether managing infrastructure, deploying applications, or collaborating with teams, everything is streamlined and ready to use—all while maintaining a strict zero-trust security model.
