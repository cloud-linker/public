# Overview

### **What is the Backbone?**

The **CloudLinker Backbone** is the foundation of your cloud infrastructure. It provides a **secure, private network layer** that enables seamless cluster deployment, multi-cloud connectivity, and strict access controls.

### **Why is the Backbone Essential?**

Before deploying any Kubernetes cluster, the Backbone ensures:\
✅ **Private Networking** – Only private Kubernetes clusters, fully isolated for security.\
✅ **VPN Integration** – Secure access to infrastructure without exposing services publicly.\
✅ **Multi-Cloud Compatibility** – A unified network layer across AWS, GCP, and Azure.\
✅ **Scalability & Isolation** – Clusters are deployed inside the Backbone with controlled access.\
✅ **One Backbone Per Cloud Provider** – Ensuring optimal connectivity and security per environment.

### **Core Features**

#### **1. Private, Pre-Configured Network Layer**

The Backbone automatically sets up:

* **VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds)** with restricted ingress and egress.
* **No public IPs on clusters**, ensuring a fully private infrastructure.
* **Inter-cluster networking** within the Backbone for seamless internal communication.

#### **2. Built-In VPN for Secure Access**

* At least **one VPN integration** is required for accessing infrastructure securely.
* Secure **VPN tunneling** for developers and applications.
* **Zero-trust access control** for internal services and workloads.
* **Cross-cloud private networking**, allowing clusters to communicate securely across providers.

#### **3. Optimized for Secure Kubernetes Deployments**

* Every cluster is **provisioned inside the Backbone** with **no public exposure**.
* **Pre-configured security policies** for compliance and risk mitigation.
* **Seamless autoscaling** without compromising security.

### **Backbone Deployment Requirements**

* At least **one Backbone per cloud provider** to ensure secure, optimized networking.
* At least **one VPN integration** for accessing and managing private clusters.

### **How the Backbone Fits Into CloudLinker**

1️⃣ **The Backbone is created first**, defining a secure, private foundation.\
2️⃣ **Clusters are deployed inside the Backbone**, inheriting its private networking and security rules.\
3️⃣ **Services, workloads, and monitoring tools** seamlessly integrate within the secure environment.
