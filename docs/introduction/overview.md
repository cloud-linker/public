# Overview

## **Built for Scalability, Security, and Multi-Cloud Flexibility**

CloudLinker provides a **production-grade Kubernetes infrastructure** designed to handle modern workloads efficiently. Our architecture is built to ensure **scalability, security, and seamless multi-cloud deployment**, allowing companies to run their applications with the same robustness as big tech.

### **Key Architectural Principles**

ðŸ”¹ **Multi-Cloud Ready** â€“ Deploy workloads across AWS, GCP, and Azure without vendor lock-in.\
ðŸ”¹ **Automated Infrastructure** â€“ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles ensure fully automated provisioning.\
ðŸ”¹ **Built-in Security** â€“ Secure defaults, encryption, and policy-based access control.\
ðŸ”¹ **Resilient & Scalable** â€“ High availability and auto-scaling mechanisms built-in.\
ðŸ”¹ **Extensible & Modular** â€“ Support for additional services like monitoring, health checks, and more.

### **Core Components**
